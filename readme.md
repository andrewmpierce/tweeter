## Tweeter

Tweeter is a Twitter clone built entirely on the MERN stack. It is still in development, but currently (7/24/17) is in a workable MVP state.

It began as a project I worked on in order to give examples to my students in the UNC Coding Boot Camp, while it still serves that purpose, its also just a fun toy I've been playing with to round out my knowledge of React and back end Javascript.

You can look at the project hosted on Heroku here: [https://desolate-shelf-17696.herokuapp.com/]
