## Tweeter

Tweeter is a Twitter clone built entirely on the MERN stack. It is still in development, but currently (7/24/17) is in a workable MVP state.

It began as a project I worked on in order to give examples to my students in the UNC Coding Boot Camp, while it still serves that purpose, its also just a fun toy I've been playing with to round out my knowledge of React and back end Javascript.

To run the project, clone down the repo and run npm start in the root folder. Then open a new terminal window and run npm start in the client folder to run the React dev server.
